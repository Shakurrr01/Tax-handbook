Within RRA, taxes and fees levied by decentralised entities are administered by the Provincial and Decentralized Revenues Division. The mandate was changed because of the greater experience and capacity of RRA in collecting revenues, facilitating taxpayers and modernising processes, which means that taxes and fees levied by decentralised entities can be collected more fairly and efficiently by RRA than by the districts themselves. The collected revenues are directly paid to the corresponding Districts bank account."
