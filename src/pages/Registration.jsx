              Business registration in Rwanda is carried out by the Office of the Registrar General (ORG) within the
              Rwanda Development Board (RDB). This is carried out online on the RDB portal rather than RRA in order

            <h3>What is Limited Liability?</h3>
            <p>
              Liability refers to the responsibility for any debts that are owed by the business. One of the advantages
              of registering a business as a company, as opposed to an individual enterprise, is that all debts incurred
              by the company are the responsibility of the company, they are not the legal liability of the shareholders
              or the directors.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this way, the liability of the people who run the company is said to be 'limited'. They are not
              responsible for all the debts of the company, only to the extent of the stake they have in the company.

              However, it is important that this 'Business Activity' category is completed as accurately as possible
              when registering. This uses the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), also used by
              the National Institute of Statistics (NISR), The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) and the Ministry of
              Finance (MINECOFIN) to improve statistics and policy making.
