                Tax debt arises when the tax due is not paid in full by the deadline upon reception of notice of assessment automatically generated by the system or after audit. It remains a liability until it is settled through payment, offset, or other arrangements like installment plans or waivers.

                In special circumstances, taxpayers may also request for taxes or penalties to be waived or dropped. Although these requests must be made to RRA, the decision to grant any waivers waive any fines or interest due is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN). However, waiving the principal tax is done by the Cabinet upon request of MINECOFIN.
