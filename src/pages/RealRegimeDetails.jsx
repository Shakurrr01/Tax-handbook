                    <p>
                        There are aspects of Real Regime Income Tax that do not apply to the other regimes. These are discussed in turn below. The process of declaring Real Regime Income Tax is described on page 158. The formula for calculation of Real Regime Income Tax is summarised on page 179.

                    <h2>What expenses can be deducted in Real Regime?</h2>
                    <p>Expenses are allowed to be deducted in Real Regime if they meet all of the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are incurred for the direct purpose of the business and are directly chargeable to the income.</li>
                        <li>They correspond to a real expense and can be substantiated with proper invoice or receipts accepted by the tax administration.</li>
                        <li>They lead to a decrease in the net assets of the business.</li>
                        <li>They are used for activities related to the tax period in which they are incurred.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For example, this includes employee expenses and RSSB contributions on behalf of the employee, office supplies, rent costs, utility costs, advertising costs, insurance costs and legal fees. It also includes fees paid to member of the Board of directors and any other member of a similar organ, although companies are required to withhold 30% on these allowances.
                    </p>
                    <p>The types of expenses that are not tax deductible include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dividends declared and profits paid-out to their beneficiaries;</li>

                        <li>The aggregate of expenses of management activities, technical services and royalty fees paid to a non-resident related person exceeding two percent (2%) of the turnover of the taxpayer;</li>
                        <li>Interest arising from loans between related persons paid or due on total loans in excess of four (4) times of the amount of paid-up equity which excludes provisions or reserves and retained earnings according to the balance sheet, which is drawn up in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles;</li>
                        <li>Realised foreign exchange loss arising from total loans between related persons in excess of four (4) times of the amount of paid-up equity which excludes provisions or reserves and retained earnings according to the balance sheet, which is drawn up in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles.</li>

                    <h2>What is the basis of depreciation in Real Regime?</h2>
                    <p>Depreciation reflects the reduction of the value of an asset over time, in particular because of wear and tear.</p>
                    <p>Assets purchased with the value below FRW 500,000 are considered as expenses and cannot be depreciated. Depreciation of all other business assets can be deducted in Real Regime on the basis described below.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The cost of purchasing, constructing and improving buildings, equipment and heavy machinery that is fixed in walls depreciates by 5% annually of the cost price.</li>
                        <li>The cost of purchasing, constructing and improving intangible assets that have been purchased from a third party depreciates by 10% annually of the cost price.</li>
                        <li>The assets in the following two categories are depreciated in a pooling system on the basis of the following rates:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Computers and accessories, information and communication systems, software products and data equipment depreciate at the rate of 50%.</li>
                                <li>All other business assets (that have not otherwise been mentioned) depreciate at the rate of 25%.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The pooling system means that all similar items of these categories can be aggregated and the cost depreciated as single items.</p>
                    <p>Land, fine arts, antiquities, jewellery and any other assets that are not subject to wear and tear and cannot become outdated or obsolete are not depreciated.</p>

                    <h2>What incentives are available for Real Regime?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are exemptions or discounts that can be applied if the taxpayer fulfils certain criteria. The types of tax discounts, incentives and exemptions allowed are subject to the Law on investment promotion and facilitation and Law establishing taxes on income, see the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and RRA websites respectively for the latest versions of these laws.

                    <h2>What if a Real Regime taxpayer does not make a profit?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If a taxpayer’s taxable income (as calculated on page 2) is less than zero, this is referred to as a net loss. If a taxpayer declares a net loss in an Income Tax declaration, this loss may be carried forward and deducted from the Income Tax declarations of the next five tax periods, with earlier losses being deducted before later losses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, a taxpayer who applies to the tax administration may be allowed to carry forward the loss for more than five (5) tax periods but without exceedingly further five (5) tax periods, if he or she fulfils the requirements that are provided for by ministerial order.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition, a taxpayer who declares a net loss in their Income Tax declaration is not required to declare and pay IQP in the following tax period.</p>

                    <h2>What are the related persons and transfer pricing requirements?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A ‘related person’ refers to any individual(s) who acts or is likely to act in accordance with the directive, opinions or wishes, communicated or not communicated, of other individual(s). This includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An individual and their spouse, direct lineal ascendants (i.e., parents or grandparents) or descendants (i.e., children or grandchildren).</li>
                        <li>A company and any individual or company who owns directly or indirectly 50% or more, by value or number, of the voting rights in the company.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Any transactions between related persons is required to be entered into the related party transactions tab. This tab is required to be completed and uploaded with all Real Regime declarations, regardless of whether the taxpayer transacted with related persons, see page 161 for details.

                        As well as the Real Regime annexures, three mandatory documents are required to be submitted for Real Regime declarations. This means that when downloading annexures for Real Regime PIT or CIT declarations, the taxpayer must download the following annexures:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Balance Sheet</li>

                        <li>Company-Representative</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These annexures can each be downloaded as normal. See page 97 for more details on downloading annexures.</p>
                    <p>The process of completing, validating and saving is different for the balance sheet, profit and loss statement and the company representative and is described in more detail below.</p>
                    <p>The balance sheet and profit and loss statements typically require the expertise of trained accountants. However, the taxpayer is ultimately responsible for the accurate completion of these documents.</p>

                    <p>In order to upload this annexure, the balance sheet spreadsheet must be validated and saved on PC/RRA Folder.</p>

                    <h3>Profit and Loss</h3>
